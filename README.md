# Battleship Game - Java

## Project Overview

The Battleship Game is a text-based implementation of the classic naval game **Battleship** in Java. Players take turns attempting to locate and sink the opponent's ships by guessing their coordinates on the target grid. The game is played entirely in the terminal, where the target board updates with each move, indicating hits, misses, and the status of the ships.

## Features

- **Game Grid**: The game displays a grid where both players' ships are placed. The grid updates each time a player makes a move.
- **Ship Placement**: Ships are randomly placed on the grid, and players must guess the coordinates to sink them.
- **Hit and Miss Indicators**: The board updates to show whether a shot resulted in a hit (indicated by "X") or a miss (indicated by "O").
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take turns guessing the coordinates on the opponent's grid.
- **Terminal Interface**: The game is played through the terminal, with clear visual feedback on each player's progress.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Terminal/Console Interface**: The game operates entirely in the terminal or console.
